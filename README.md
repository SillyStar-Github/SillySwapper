# SillySwapper
Icon swapper for the new GD Lite update. I wanted to make this because it's ass to manually do it.

# What does this actually do?
A basic ass script that just swaps the icon you choose for another icon you choose. It changes the .plist files to just display a different icon over the other.

# How do I use this?
Download the zip file in Releases, extract it all into one folder, and run the IconSwapper.py file.

When you open it, you'll first be prompted with a list of icon types. Just enter the number matching to the icon type you want to swap.

After you type in the number, choose the quality type. Self explanatory.

Now, you will be prompted to type in the number for the icon you want. To see the icon numbers, go into the icons folder from the zip file and type in the number found in the file name.

After that, you will be asked for the icon you want to swap it with. This will be the icon you replace, so the first icon number will be in your game and this will be the one it replaces.

Now, the script will run itself, and a new file will be created next to the script file.

Just put this file in the GD Lite app directory where the icon folder is. The icons should be swapped!
